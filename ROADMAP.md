  - [ ] Python type hints integration
  - [ ] Virtual environment management
  - [ ] Package dependency handling

### Phase 3.3: TypeScript Support
- [ ] **TypeScript MCP Server Templates**
  - [ ] Express/Fastify template options
  - [ ] Strong typing throughout
  - [ ] npm/yarn package management
  - [ ] Modern ES modules support
  - [ ] Zod schema validation

### Phase 3.4: Additional Languages
- [ ] **Java** (Spring Boot templates)
- [ ] **Go** (Gin/Echo templates)
- [ ] **PHP** (Laravel/Symfony templates)
- [ ] **Ruby** (Rails/Sinatra templates)

## Priority 4: MCP Client Generation üè≠

**Goal:** After mastering MCP client development, generate clients in multiple languages for consuming MCP servers.

- [ ] **Client Template Architecture**
  - [ ] Generic client interface patterns
  - [ ] Language-specific implementations
  - [ ] OpenAPI ‚Üí MCP client mapping
  - [ ] Authentication handling
  - [ ] Error management patterns

- [ ] **Multi-Language Client Support**
  - [ ] C# MCP clients (HttpClient-based)
  - [ ] Python MCP clients (aiohttp/requests)
  - [ ] TypeScript MCP clients (fetch/axios)
  - [ ] Java MCP clients (OkHttp/RestTemplate)
  - [ ] Go MCP clients (net/http)

- [ ] **Client Features**
  - [ ] Async/await patterns
  - [ ] Connection pooling
  - [ ] Retry mechanisms
  - [ ] Caching strategies
  - [ ] Monitoring integration

## Priority 5: AI Agent Ecosystem ü¶ç

**Goal:** Build the infrastructure for AI agents to discover, register, and collaborate with each other.

- [ ] **MCP Server Registry**
  - [ ] Centralized server discovery
  - [ ] Capability indexing
  - [ ] Version management
  - [ ] Health monitoring
  - [ ] Usage analytics

- [ ] **Agent Orchestration**
  - [ ] Multi-agent workflow coordination
  - [ ] Dependency resolution
  - [ ] Load balancing
  - [ ] Fault tolerance
  - [ ] Performance optimization

- [ ] **Developer Tools**
  - [ ] MCP server testing tools
  - [ ] Agent communication debugger
  - [ ] Performance profiling
  - [ ] Integration testing suite
  - [ ] Documentation generation

## Future Considerations üîÆ

*Lower priority items that align with the mission but come after core AI agent infrastructure:*

### Workflow Integration (Later)
- [ ] n8n workflow generation (AI agent ‚Üí workflow tools)
- [ ] Trigger.dev integration templates
- [ ] Zapier app scaffolding (for AI agent exposure)

### Developer Experience (Later)
- [ ] VS Code extension for MCP development
- [ ] Web playground for testing
- [ ] Visual flow builder for agent interactions

### Advanced Features (Later)
- [ ] Claude Code Flow integration
- [ ] Multi-terminal AI collaboration
- [ ] Auto-optimized code generation
- [ ] Real-time collaborative development

## Success Metrics üéØ

1. **MCP Adoption**: Number of generated MCP servers in production
2. **Language Coverage**: Percentage of popular languages supported
3. **A2A Integration**: Number of A2A-compatible agent systems
4. **Community Growth**: Developer adoption and contribution rates
5. **Ecosystem Health**: Active agent-to-agent communications
